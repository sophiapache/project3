### Overview

Atomic Academy is an educational science website aimed for an audience looking to acquire knowledge in elementary biology, chemistry, and physics. A user can log in and browse various lessons that use both text information and videos to teach. The server keeps track of where the user was last in the lesson so that if they return to the lesson, their position in the slides is remembered.

Once they complete the lesson, they can take a quiz to test their knowledge on the subject. Once the quiz is completed, they receive a badge on their profile and are able to see their grade later on the profile.
